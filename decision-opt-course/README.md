This is the code for Dan Becker's Decision Optimization course. Notes on the notebooks and code

- 1_profit_curves.ipynb: Notebook used in the first lesson
- 2_theory.ipynb: Notebook showing the behavior of different loss functions
- 2_bimbo.ipynb: Applying decision optimization for regression.
- 3_dynamic_opt_data_prep.ipynb: This creates the saved models and artifacts used in `3_dynamic_decision_opt.ipynb`. This calls `./utils/modeling.py`
- 3_dynamic_decision_opt.ipynb: This repository doesn't contain all of the saved model files. So run `3_dynamic_opt_data_prep.ipynb` before this.
